          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>In 2018, I enrolled in Middle Georgia State University and started learning how to code. Since then I have created several small projects ranging from text base version of checkers
            to interactive web forms.</p>

          <h3>PC Repair & Diagnostics</h3>
          <p>I got my start building, repairing, and tuning computers. After I built my first Gaming PC, I was hooked. I wanted to learn everything I could about computer diagnostics and system maintenance.
            After hours of study, I was able to pass the CompTIA A+ exam and got my first certification. Soon after, I was hired as an onsite support technician.</p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>I have been a gaming enthusiast since I was a kid. I tried playing competitively, I built my own Gaming PC, and I even learned how to program my own games.
            Over time, I gained a wealth of experience understanding game design and development and apply the same principals to web development.</p>

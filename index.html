        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am an experienced IT Generalist with over a decade of hands-on experience in computer break/fix repair, building high-end desktops, system administration, application support, technology installation, and more.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am working towards a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology with a concentration on Web Development. Additionally, I am taking a few courses on the side to expand my knowledge of Python programming and Game Development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Gaming is a lifelong passion of mine. I stumbled into computer repair when I tried upgrading my personal office desktop into a gaming desktop. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that the existing components could not handle the added stress and it overloaded the motherboard. After reading several tutorials on how to troubleshoot, fix, and build a gaming desktop, I was able to rebuild the computer from scratch. When the lights came on, and a machine I had built myself booted up without issues, I was overjoyed and instantly hooked on learning more about technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          This experience led me to pursue a career in information technology.

            A Text-based RPG built using Javascript.<br />
            The inspiration came from a course project by freecodecamp and I greatly expanded upon it by adding in new stats, new levels, new enemies, new items, key items, reworked the combat mathematics, <br />
            and much, much more. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚

          <h3>PC Repair & Diagnostics</h3>
          <p>I got my start building, repairing, and tuning computers. After I built my first Gaming PC, I was hooked. I wanted to learn everything I could about computer diagnostics and system maintenance.
            After hours of study, I was able to pass the CompTIA A+ exam and got my first certification. Soon after, I was hired as an onsite support technician.</p>

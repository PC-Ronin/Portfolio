        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I'm a web developer who builds functional, user-focused websites that help businesses connect with their customers online.
          <br />
          With a background in IT, I understand the technical side of web development - but I also know that great websites need to solve real problems. Whether it's building a custom WordPress site, creating interactive web applications, or troubleshooting complex technical challenges, I focus on delivering solutions that actually work.
          <br />
          I recently completed my Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development, where I led a team project building a full community platform from the ground up - managing everything from initial concept and documentation through to plugin development and launch.
          <br />
          When I'm not coding or tinkering with computers, you'll find me gaming, reading, or experimenting in the kitchen with Asian and Italian cuisines.

            A Text-based RPG built using Javascript.<br />
            The inspiration came from a course project by freecodecamp and I greatly expanded upon it by adding in new stats, new levels, new enemies, new items, key items, reworked the combat mathematics, <br />
            and much, much more. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>In 2018, I enrolled in Middle Georgia State University and started learning how to code. Since then I have created several small projects ranging from text base version of checkers
            to interactive web forms.</p>

          <h3>PC Repair & Diagnostics</h3>
          <p>I got my start building, repairing, and tuning computers. After I built my first Gaming PC, I was hooked. I wanted to learn everything I could about computer diagnostics and system maintenance.
            After hours of study, I was able to pass the CompTIA A+ exam and got my first certification. Soon after, I was hired as an onsite support technician.</p>
